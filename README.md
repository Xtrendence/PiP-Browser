# PiP Browser

PiP Browser is an extremely simple application that can display the content of a URL either in an iFrame, or as an image. It was designed to work with IP cam apps for Android devices. 

The picture-in-picture window is borderless, can be moved, resized, and set to always stay on top of other windows.

Please use the [Releases](https://github.com/Xtrendence/PiP-Browser/releases) section to download the application.
